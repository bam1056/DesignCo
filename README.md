# DesignCo
Homework Day 2
This project is made to emulate a DesignCo website as given by The Iron Yard assignment combining the knowledge of HTML, CSS and flex box that we have obtained in our 3 hours of lecture thus far. 

There are a lot of cheats and ugly HTML/CSS here, but that's because I have a lot to learn. Any comments on how to better accomplish the goals achieved in the layouts in these pages would be SUPER welcome. Help me be a better developer! Cheers!
